# System Verilog implementation of integer arithmetic
## Disclaimer
**The code provided in this repository is something I worked on in my free time to learn System Verilog and brush up on digital design from the point of view of someone who was a VHDL (research) digital designer in a previous life.
The code is not production-level and was neither thoroughly tested nor formally verified.**
